Welcome to my interactive portfolio, showcasing my skills and projects as an aspiring entry-level/junior developer. This project is crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, highlighting a variety of key features to provide a dynamic and user-friendly experience.

Key Features:

## Hero Section with Slideshow:
Engage visitors with a visually appealing slideshow in the hero section, highlighting key projects and skills.

## Contact Section:
Seamlessly interact with the contact form, allowing users to reach out easily. The contact popup can be closed by clicking anywhere outside it or using the dedicated exit button.

## Resume Page:
Explore my professional journey and skills in the dedicated resume page, providing a comprehensive overview of my capabilities.

## Menu and Footer Components:
Achieve modular code organization by incorporating separate HTML files for the menu and footer. This is implemented using XMLHttpRequest and .onreadystatechange for efficient loading and rendering.

## Connect with Me:
Let's connect and discuss opportunities! Feel free to reach out through the contact form or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandru-nedelcu-office/, "LinkedIn X").
